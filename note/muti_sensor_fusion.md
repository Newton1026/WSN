The term information fusion(IF) is used for the fusion of any kind of data and data source and is also applicable in the context of data mining and database integration.  The term sensor fusion means the combination of sensory data or data derived from sensory data. In other words, data fusion from multiple sensors, which could be of the same type of different types. Data fusion means combining information from several sources, in a sensible way, in order to estimate or predict some aspect of an observed scene, leading to the building of a world model of the environment.
