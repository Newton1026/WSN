# Belief consensus algorithms for fast distributed target tracking in wireless sensor networks

The traditional approach to target tracking is based on Kalman filtering(KF). However, due to nonlinear relationships and possible non-Gaussian uncertainties, a PF is prefered in many scenarios. 

If each node broadcasts observations until all the nodes have complete set of observations until all the nodes have complete set of observations. Then each node performs the tracking. This method, known as *data flooding* and used in non-centralized PF(NCPF), is not scalable, but can be competitive in some scenarios.
