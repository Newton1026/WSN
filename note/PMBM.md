ref: Poisson multi-Bernoulli conjugate prior for multiple extended object estimation
This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture(PMBM) conjugate prior for multiple extended object estimation. A Possion point process is used to describe the existence of yet undetected targets, while a multi-Bernoulli mixture desribes the distribution of the targets that have been detected. 

In Bayesian probability theory, the concepts *conjugacy* and *conjugate prior*  are important. Conjugate prior can be formally defined as follows:

> In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterio

Conjugacy in the context of MTT means that  *"if we start with the proposed conjugate initial prior, then all subsequent predicted and posterior distributions have the same form as the initial prior"*. For point target MTT, under the standard point target model, at least two types of RFS conjugate priors have been presented: a GLMB conjugate prior, and a PMBM conjugate prior.
