# Message Passing methods
## Introduction
Belief propagation(BP) is a way of organizing the global computation of
marginal beliefs in terms of smaller local computations within the
graph. It is one of the best-known *message passing* methods for distributed
inference in statistical physics, AI, CV, localization, etc. The whole computation
takes a time proportional o the number of links in the graph, which is significantly less
than the exponential time that would be requred to compute marginal probabilities naively.
## Belief Propagation(BP)
In the standard BP algorithm, the belief at a node $t$ (approximation of the posterior marginal PDF) is proportional to the product of the local evidence at that node $\psi_t(x_t)$, and all the messages coming into node $t$:
$$
M_t(x_t) = k \psi_t(x_t)\prod_{\mu \in G_t}m_{\mu t}(x_t)
$$
where $x_t$ is a state of node $t$, $k$ is a normalization constant, and $G_t$ denotes the neighbors of node $t$.
